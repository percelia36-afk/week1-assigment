# week1-assigment

in this project I feel like I achived the following goals:
1 I wrapped the the sections of trhe website in the conrect sematic tags as result my page has a header, nav bar and footer.
4 In addition to this i used flexbox too wrap the header text and nav bar into a chohesive stylistic unit . This gave me somme isses as it would hide between the backround images . This was solved by asking for some instructor feedback.
I used absulute possitioning css in ored to make my boxes overlay corctley over the background image . However the images where put into the webpage using css and not html.
In addition to this i added hover to the afformetioned boxes. using .button-box:hover {
background-color: green; } as my css selevtion tag
some resources i used were for css in order to stop the nav elements from changing color and remove the hiperlink underline from nav bar.
